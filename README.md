# Aspera Transfer with SLURM

This project provides a way to transfer raw cryoEM data (tiff images) to EMPIAR database using Aspera in combination with SLURM for job scheduling. The configuration file allows you to customize the settings for your transfer and SLURM job. The scripts were developed to be compatible with Athena supercomputer enviroment in Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH.

## Prerequisites

- Aspera Connect installed and configured.
- Python installed.

## Usage 

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafalradx/aspera-transfer-utils
cd aspera-transfer-utils
```
### 2. Make sure you have `python-dotenv` installed
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```
### 3. Configuration

Edit the `config.txt` file to specify your settings:

```bash
# Aspera settings
ASCP_PATH=/home/user/.aspera/connect/bin/ascp
ASPERA_TOKEN=EMPIAR_upload_token
ASPERA_SCP_PASS=EMPIAR_super_secret_password
TRANSFER_SPEED=200M

# Path to raw images (tiff's) directory
TIFF_PATH=/home/user/cryoEM/data

# Unique name for scripts naming (project, sample, id, etc)
NAME_ID=super_important_sample

# Number of files in a batch to be sent in one SLURM job
BATCH_SIZE=1500

# SLURM job settings
JOB_NAME=aspera_transfer

# Job max lifetime (in hours)
TIME=48

# Grant SLURM name (Athena style name)
ACCOUNT=mygrant-gpu-a100
```
### 4. Run the `empiar_prep.py` script
```bash
python empiar_prep.py
```
The script splits files into batches and moves them into subdirectories: subdir1, subdir2, etc. It may take some time. Be patient.
Once it's done it generates SLURM submission scripts for each batch of files.
Example of output:
```bash
Number of files to send: 3027
Number of batches: 4
Files split and sbatch scripts created successfully!
```
If the script does not find any files in provided directory (`TIFF_PATH`), it assumes that the files are already split in subdirectories.
So you can safely run the script twice on the same directory if you want to adjust your configuration.

### 5. Submit a SLURM job by running sbatch for each script created
``` bash
sbatch super_important_sample_subdir1.sh
```
### 6. Use `check_status.py` script to monitor upload progress 
```batch
python check_status.py transfer_log/super_important_sample_subdir1_err.txt
```
Run this script for each error log in `transfer_log` directory. 
Example output:
```batch
Total files to transfer: 1133
Transfers started: 58
Transfers completed successfully: 56
Progress: 4.94%
```

### 7. Use `validate_files.py` to validate transfered files once the transfer is completed
Download the uploaded files list from EMPIAR deposition session, save it and transfer it to your working directory on Athena.
e.g. `uploaded_files.txt`. The file should only contain file list! Run the script
```batch
python validate_files.py uploaded_files.txt
```
The script takes path to source directory (`TIFF_PATH`) from `config.txt`
Example output:
```batch
Files listed in: 'uploaded_files.txt'
Source directory to compare: 'home/user/data'
Number of files in the list: 3027
Number of files in the source directory: 3027
Files listed in text file but not in source directory:
None

Files in source directory but not listed in text file:
None

Files with size mismatches:
None

```

Example of mismatch in transfered files:
```batch
Files listed in: 'uploaded_files.txt'
Source directory to compare: 'home/user/data'
Number of files in the list: 3026
Number of files in the source directory: 3027
Files listed in text file but not in source directory:
FoilHole_10140984_Data_10137141_10137143_20220912_11959_fractions.tiff
FoilHole_10140915_Data_10137141_10137143_20220912_11706_fractions.tiff

Files in source directory but not listed in text file:
FoilHole_10140915_Data_10137141_10137143_20220912_110706_fractions.tiff
FoilHole_10141064_Data_10137138_10137140_20220912_112643_fractions.tiff
FoilHole_10140984_Data_10137141_10137143_20220912_112959_fractions.tiff

Files with size mismatches:
FoilHole_10140907_Data_10137141_10137143_20220912_105607_fractions.tiff: Listed size = 3825548, Source size = 382554858
FoilHole_10140892_Data_10137144_10137146_20220912_111143_fractions.tiff: Listed size = 3811442, Source size = 381144892

```

## Notes
* Ensure that the `ASCP_PATH` is correctly set to the Aspera Connect ascp binary installed on your cyfronet Athena account.
* Make sure you have correct upload token `ASPERA_TOKEN` and password `ASPERA_SCP_PASS` provided in upload section of EMPIAR deposition process.
* The SLURM job will output log files named `${NAME_ID}_subdir1_log.txt` and `${NAME_ID}_subdir1_err.txt` in `transfer_log` directory for each subdirectory submitted for file transfer.
